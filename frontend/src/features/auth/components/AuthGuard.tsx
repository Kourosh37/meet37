Frontend architecture note

File: src\features\auth\components\AuthGuard.tsx
Layer: Authentication

Responsibility:
- Frontend file for the Authentication layer. It should implement only the responsibility implied by its route/feature name and should stay aligned with frontend-architecture.md.

Implementation contract:
- Keep this file narrowly scoped; do not mix unrelated feature state, route rendering, and infrastructure concerns.
- Prefer feature-local components/hooks/stores first, then shared lib utilities only when behavior is reused across features.
- Match the existing backend contract exactly; if backend/docs/API.md or backend/docs/WEBSOCKET.md changes, update this file's types and assumptions in the same change.

Backend contract: POST /api/auth/login, POST /api/auth/refresh, POST /api/auth/logout; admin-only user creation must go through /api/admin/users unless compatibility registration is explicitly needed.

State model to plan: anonymous, authenticating, authenticated user, authenticated admin, refreshing, expired, and logout complete.

UX and edge cases to plan:
- Display clear loading and empty states instead of rendering nothing once implementation starts.
- Normalize backend errors into user-safe messages while preserving technical details for logger.ts.
- Keep room links shareable; never require global login just to open an existing meeting link.
- In private app mode, require login only for room creation, not for joining a shared room link.
- Every meeting participant must provide a non-empty display name before joining.

Security and privacy notes:
- Never expose refresh tokens to arbitrary components; use the storage/auth layer only.
- Treat host_token as room-scoped moderation authority and avoid leaking it into URLs or logs.
- Do not persist raw media streams, SDP blobs, ICE candidates, or file bytes unless a later backend feature explicitly requires it.

Future tests: login success/failure, token persistence, refresh rotation, logout revocation, admin/user role branching, and unauthorized redirects.

// Auth guard placeholder.

// Planned responsibilities:
// - Gate admin and private-mode creation UI by auth state.
// - Redirect unauthenticated users to login when route-level protection is needed.
// - Avoid storing routing policy in visual components.
